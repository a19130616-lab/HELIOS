## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### 1. API Configuration
Edit `config/config.ini` and add your Binance API credentials:

```ini
[binance]
api_key = your_actual_api_key_here
api_secret = your_actual_api_secret_here
testnet = True  # Set to False for live trading
```

### 2. Risk Parameters
Adjust risk settings according to your preferences:

```ini
[risk]
kelly_fraction = 0.5          # Use 50% of Kelly recommendation
leverage = 10                 # Maximum leverage to use
warning_margin_ratio = 30     # Warning threshold (%)
critical_margin_ratio = 15    # Emergency threshold (%)
```

### 3. Trading Configuration
Configure signal and trading parameters:

```ini
[signals]
nobi_depth = 10                    # Order book depth for NOBI calculation
nobi_trigger_threshold = 0.4       # NOBI threshold for signal generation
ml_confidence_threshold = 0.75     # ML model confidence requirement

[trading]
watchlist_size = 5                 # Number of symbols to monitor
rescan_interval_sec = 300          # Watchlist update interval
```

### 4. Azure Monitor (Optional)
For cloud monitoring, add your Azure connection string:

```ini
[azure]
connection_string = your_azure_monitor_connection_string
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the System

### 1. Start Redis (if not running)
```bash
redis-server
```

### 2. Create Required Directories
```bash
mkdir -p logs models
```

### 3. Prepare ML Model (Optional)
If you have a trained XGBoost model, place it in the `models/` directory:
```bash
cp your_model.json models/xgb_model.json
cp your_scaler.pkl models/xgb_model_scaler.pkl
```

### 4. Start Helios
```bash
python main.py
```

## üìä System Components

### Data Ingestor
- Connects to Binance WebSocket streams
- Processes order book, trade, and kline data
- Stores normalized data in Redis for other components

### Signal Engine
- Calculates NOBI from real-time order book data
- Applies ML model for signal validation
- Publishes trading signals to execution queue

### Risk Manager
- Implements Kelly Criterion position sizing
- Manages dynamic trailing stop losses
- Monitors account margin and executes emergency protocols

### Execution Manager
- Receives and validates trading signals
- Places and manages orders via Binance API
- Coordinates with Risk Manager for position tracking

### Monitoring Agent
- Collects system and performance metrics
- Sends data to Azure Monitor (if configured)
- Generates alerts for critical conditions

## üìà Monitoring and Logs

### Log Files
- `logs/helios.log`: Main system log
- `logs/alerts.log`: Critical alerts and warnings

### Key Metrics Monitored
- **Performance**: Win rate, PnL, Sharpe ratio, drawdown
- **Risk**: Margin ratio, position exposure, leverage usage
- **System**: Component health, latency, error rates
- **Trading**: Signal generation, execution success, order fill rates

### Health Checks
The system continuously monitors:
- Component responsiveness
- API connectivity
- Data stream integrity
- Risk threshold violations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings

### Financial Risk
- **This is experimental software**: Use at your own risk
- **Start with testnet**: Always test thoroughly before live trading
- **Never risk more than you can afford to lose**
- **High-frequency trading carries significant risks**

### Security
- **Protect your API keys**: Never commit them to version control
- **Use IP restrictions**: Configure Binance API for specific IPs only
- **Enable 2FA**: Use two-factor authentication on your exchange account
- **Monitor regularly**: Keep track of all trading activity

### Technical Considerations
- **Latency matters**: Use a VPS close to exchange servers for optimal performance
- **Monitor data feeds**: Ensure continuous data connectivity
- **Resource usage**: The system requires sufficient CPU and memory
- **Network stability**: Unstable connections can cause trading issues

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Redis Connection Failed**
```bash
# Check if Redis is running
redis-cli ping
# Should return "PONG"
```

**Binance API Errors**
- Verify API key and secret are correct
- Check if API has futures trading permissions
- Ensure IP is whitelisted (if IP restriction enabled)

**No Trading Signals Generated**
- Check if market is open and liquid
- Verify NOBI threshold is not too high
- Ensure ML model is loaded correctly

**High Memory Usage**
- Reduce watchlist size
- Increase data cleanup intervals
- Monitor Redis memory usage

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting in `config.ini`:
```ini
[system]
log_level = DEBUG
```

## üìö Algorithm Details

### NOBI Calculation
```
NOBI = (Depth_ask - Depth_bid) / (Depth_ask + Depth_bid)
```
Where depth is calculated as the sum of price √ó quantity for the top L levels.

### Kelly Criterion Position Sizing
```
Kelly% = Win_Rate - (1 - Win_Rate) / Win_Loss_Ratio
Position_Size = Kelly% √ó Kelly_Fraction √ó Available_Balance
```

### Trailing Stop Logic
- Initial stop: Entry_Price ¬± (ATR √ó Multiplier)
- Trailing update: Stop follows favorable price movement
- Trigger: Current price crosses stop level

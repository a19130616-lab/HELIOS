# Helios High-Frequency Trading System

A sophisticated, AI-powered cryptocurrency trading bot designed for minute-level contract trading on major exchanges like Binance Futures. Helios combines market microstructure analysis with machine learning to identify and execute high-probability trading opportunities.

## üöÄ Key Features

### Core Strategy
- **Normalized Order Book Imbalance (NOBI)**: Real-time analysis of order book pressure to identify trading opportunities
- **AI-Powered Signal Filtering**: LSTM+XGBoost hybrid model for sophisticated signal validation
- **Reddit Sentiment Analysis**: Real-time sentiment analysis from cryptocurrency-related subreddits
- **Enhanced Trend Analysis**: Multi-timeframe trend detection with momentum indicators
- **Dynamic Asset Selection**: Automated scanning for optimal volatility-liquidity balance
- **Market Regime Detection**: Adaptive strategy parameters based on market conditions

### Risk Management
- **Kelly Criterion Position Sizing**: Mathematical optimization of position sizes
- **Dynamic Trailing Stops**: ATR-based stop losses that adapt to market volatility
- **Multi-Level Risk Controls**: Account-level liquidation avoidance protocol
- **Emergency De-risking**: Automated position reduction during high-risk scenarios

### System Architecture
- **Microservices Design**: Modular, scalable architecture with independent components
- **Real-time Data Processing**: High-frequency WebSocket streams from Binance
- **Redis-based Communication**: Fast inter-service messaging and data storage
- **Azure Monitor Integration**: Cloud-based monitoring and alerting

### Operating Modes
Helios operates in explicitly gated modes to ensure safe defaults:
| Mode | Trigger Condition | Data Source | Trading | Active Components |
|------|------------------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| live (testnet/mainnet) | Valid Binance API key & secret | Authenticated WebSocket streams | Enabled | DataIngestor + ExecutionManager + PerformanceTracker |
| public (read‚Äëonly) | Missing/placeholder credentials AND ALLOW_PUBLIC_MODE=true | Binance REST polling + CoinGecko fallback | Disabled | PublicPriceIngestor + DecisionLogger |
| synthetic (legacy) | ALLOW_SYNTHETIC=true (no valid creds) | Internal generators | Disabled | DataIngestor (synthetic threads) |

Resolution priority: (1) live if valid credentials ‚Üí (2) public if allowed ‚Üí (3) synthetic if explicitly enabled ‚Üí otherwise abort.

### Decision Logging & Simulated PnL
When trading is disabled (public / synthetic), signals are still produced and persisted:
- DecisionLogger subscribes to the Redis channel trading_signals and appends normalized entries (list: decision_logs, length ‚â§500, 24h TTL).
- Signal directions now include EXIT_LONG and EXIT_SHORT enabling explicit position closure events.
- Realized PnL is computed only on EXIT_* events using a configurable fixed position size (simulation mode) and stored per entry (realized_pnl, position_size).
- Aggregated simulated performance metrics are maintained in Redis key simulated_pnl_summary (fields: total_pnl, total_trades, wins, losses, win_rate, max_drawdown_pct, peak_equity, updated_ts).
- /api/performance automatically falls back to simulated_pnl_summary when no live execution data is available (public/synthetic modes) so the dashboard shows continuous performance feedback.

### EXIT Signal Semantics
- LONG / SHORT: Open (or replace) a single simulated position per symbol direction.
- EXIT_LONG / EXIT_SHORT: Close the existing position (if any) and realize PnL = (exit_price - entry_price) * position_size (sign adjusted for direction).
- Positions are tracked in-memory by DecisionLogger; unmatched EXIT_* events are safely ignored (logged).

### Configuration Additions
Add a [simulation] section to config/config.ini to control position sizing for simulated PnL (see Configuration section below).

### Safety Principles
- No implicit "demo" fallback: system aborts if neither credentials nor an allowed read-only/synthetic mode are configured.
- Mode badge (LIVE / PUBLIC / SYNTHETIC) shown on dashboard and included in /api/prices response.
- Staleness indicators flag price rows older than threshold (e.g., >60s).

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+**: Required for all dependencies
- **Redis Server**: For inter-service communication and caching
- **Binance Futures Account**: API keys with futures trading permissions
- **Azure Account** (optional): For cloud monitoring integration

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd Helios
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment
```bash
python -m venv helios-env
source helios-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: helios-env\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Install Redis
**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis-server
```

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install redis
brew services start redis
```

**Windows:**
Download and install Redis from the official website or use WSL.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### 1. API Configuration
Edit `config/config.ini` and add your Binance API credentials:

```ini
[binance]
api_key = your_actual_api_key_here
api_secret = your_actual_api_secret_here
testnet = True  # Set to False for live trading
```

### 2. Risk Parameters
Adjust risk settings according to your preferences:

```ini
[risk]
kelly_fraction = 0.5          # Use 50% of Kelly recommendation
leverage = 10                 # Maximum leverage to use
warning_margin_ratio = 30     # Warning threshold (%)
critical_margin_ratio = 15    # Emergency threshold (%)
```

### 3. Trading & Simulation Configuration
Configure signal, trading, and (optional) simulation parameters:

```ini
[signals]
nobi_depth = 10                    # Order book depth for NOBI calculation
nobi_trigger_threshold = 0.4       # NOBI threshold for signal generation
ml_confidence_threshold = 0.75     # ML model confidence requirement

[trading]
watchlist_size = 5                 # Number of symbols to monitor
rescan_interval_sec = 300          # Watchlist update interval

[simulation]
position_size = 1.0                # Fixed contract/asset size used for simulated PnL when trading disabled
```

Notes:
- position_size only affects simulated realized_pnl calculations in public/synthetic modes.
- EXIT_LONG / EXIT_SHORT signals must be emitted by the strategy logic (SignalEngine) to realize PnL; without EXIT events simulated results remain unrealized.
### 4. Azure Monitor (Optional)
For cloud monitoring, add your Azure connection string:

```ini
[azure]
connection_string = your_azure_monitor_connection_string
```

- Check if API has futures trading permissions
- Ensure IP is whitelisted (if IP restriction enabled)

**No Trading Signals Generated**
- Check if market is open and liquid
- Verify NOBI threshold is not too high
- Ensure ML model is loaded correctly

**High Memory Usage**
- Reduce watchlist size
- Increase data cleanup intervals
- Monitor Redis memory usage

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting in `config.ini`:
```ini
[system]
log_level = DEBUG
```

## üìö Algorithm Details

### NOBI Calculation
```
NOBI = (Depth_ask - Depth_bid) / (Depth_ask + Depth_bid)
```
Where depth is calculated as the sum of price √ó quantity for the top L levels.

### Kelly Criterion Position Sizing
```
Kelly% = Win_Rate - (1 - Win_Rate) / Win_Loss_Ratio
Position_Size = Kelly% √ó Kelly_Fraction √ó Available_Balance
```

### Trailing Stop Logic
- Initial stop: Entry_Price ¬± (ATR √ó Multiplier)
- Trailing update: Stop follows favorable price movement
- Trigger: Current price crosses stop level

## One-Click Installation

### For Linux/macOS:

✅ **Provides next steps**  

## After Installation

### 1. Configure API Keys
Edit `config/config.ini` and add your Binance credentials:
```ini
[binance]
api_key = your_actual_api_key_here
api_secret = your_actual_api_secret_here
testnet = True  # IMPORTANT: Start with testnet!
```

### 2. Start Trading
```bash
# Activate virtual environment (if not already active)
source helios-env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or
helios-env\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows

# Run the system
python main.py
```

## Quick Verification

Test if everything is working:
```bash
python -c "from app.utils import calculate_nobi; print('✅ Helios is ready!')"
```

## Safety First! 🛡️
